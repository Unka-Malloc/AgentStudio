# Version Governance Module

`server/platform/common/version-control` is the infrastructure boundary for Pact version governance. It owns the shared vocabulary, registry facts, scan rules, and gates for platform, protocol, schema, capability package, runtime dependency, and migration-path versions.

## Layer

- Layer: Common / Infrastructure
- Protocol family: `v0.0.1:version-governance:protocol-1`
- Product boundary: version governance, not release approval or source control

## Source-Controlled Configuration

- Singleton registry: `server/platform/common/version-control/version-registry.json`
- Registry schema: `server/platform/common/version-control/version-registry.schema.json`
- Scan contract: `server/platform/common/version-control/version-scan.mjs`
- Naming verifier: `npm run server:verify:version-naming`
- Verifier: `npm run server:verify:version-registry`
- Runtime artifact store root: `.pact-server-data/artifacts`
- Platform version baseline: `v0.0.1`
- Governed version format: `v<platform-version>:<domain>:<subsection>-<version>`

The registry stores version-governance facts: versioned artifact identities, `artifactId@v<platform-version>:<domain>:<subsection>-<version>` references, artifact lifecycle state, transition paths, compatibility table rows, runtime artifact references, and evidence references. The registry verifier scans source, tests, external services, MCP connector files, server-web files, and docs; every governed version string it finds must resolve to a registry artifact version. It does not store materialized payload bodies, generated reports, recovery packages, or runtime state.

## Responsibilities

1. Maintain a source-controlled singleton Version Registry for every current platform-governed version identity found in the repository.
2. Define migration path configuration as explicit `fromVersion -> toVersion` transitions.
3. Preserve adjacent-version migration rules, compatibility windows, retirement state, and evidence references.
4. Maintain a Version Compatibility Table for `consumerRef -> providerRef` compatibility facts.
5. Export compatibility projections for UI, diagnostics, and release-readiness consumers without making those consumers the source of truth.
6. Reference materialized version artifacts in `.pact-server-data/artifacts` without treating that artifact store as the configuration authority.

## Identity

- Version artifact IDs use stable dotted names such as `pact.platform`, `pact.protocol.mcp`, `pact.store.tool-management`, and `pact.runtime-dependency.gerrit`.
- Version artifact references use `artifactId@v<platform-version>:<domain>:<subsection>-<version>`.
- The platform version segment is shared across the platform baseline; the domain segment groups versions such as `workspace`, `risk-control`, `state-machine`, `storage`, or `mcp`; the subsection segment identifies the independently incrementing governed object.
- Examples: `pact.platform@v0.0.1:platform:assembly-1`, `pact.protocol.mcp@v0.0.1:mcp:interface-1`, and `pact.state-machine.version-artifact-lifecycle@v0.0.1:state-machine:version-artifact-1`.

## Lifecycle

Versioned artifacts use the shared `version.artifact.lifecycle` state machine:

```text
draft -> candidate -> active -> deprecated -> retired
```

`retired` is terminal. Activation, deprecation, and retirement are protected transitions because they change which version facts may be selected for new bindings.

Version transitions use the shared `version.transition.lifecycle` state machine:

```text
planned -> dry_run_passed -> checkpointed -> running -> verified -> completed
```

`failed` is a recoverable state that must resolve through guarded `retry`, `rollback`, or `abandon`. `completed`, `rolled_back`, and `abandoned` are terminal states. This lifecycle governs the migration action between two `artifactId@version` references; it does not replace the lifecycle of either versioned artifact.

## Non-goals

- It is not git or source-code version control.
- It is not a release page, release note generator, or production-readiness gate.
- It is not an artifact payload store.
- It must not let individual domains own hidden startup migrations, old-format version retention paths, or long-lived compatibility branches.
- It must not store secret values as migration or version evidence.
